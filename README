# Voice Typing

Whisper-based voice dictation for Linux/Wayland.

## Install

$ sudo pacman -S wtype
$ uv tool install .

## Usage

Bind `whisper-dictation-toggle` to a key in your Sway config:

    bindsym XF86Favorites exec whisper-dictation-toggle

- First press: loads model (yellow status), then starts recording (red status)
- Second press: stops recording, transcribes, types result
- Subsequent presses: instant toggle (model stays loaded)

## How it works

- `whisper-dictation-daemon`: background process that keeps the Whisper model in VRAM
- `whisper-dictation-toggle`: starts daemon if needed, toggles recording via signal

The daemon stays running after first use for instant recording on subsequent toggles.
It auto-shuts down after 5 minutes idle to free VRAM.

## Stop daemon manually

$ pkill -f whisper-dictation-daemon
